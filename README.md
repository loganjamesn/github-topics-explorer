# GitHub Topic Explorer 

Author: [Logan Nottbohm](https://github.com/loganjamesn)

## Assignment:

Your task is to build a React web application that displays all the "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#topic)" related to the term "react", using the GitHub GraphQL API.

The application should display how many "[stargazers](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection)" each topic has. A click on a topic should display the topics related to that topic, and how many stargazers they have. And so forth. There should also be Search capability to search/query on any term or topic.Â You should implement best practices with the UI. 

To interact with the Github GraphQL API you'll need to have
  * a [Github API key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql)
  * You'll want to make use of the key in the .env file within your application

You may use whatever React framework or library you find useful. URL routing is optional.


## Evaluation:

* We will pay particular attention to the way the code is organized, and to the overall readability
* Unit tests will be greatly appreciated
* Design will be ignored, however usability and accessibility will be taken into consideration
* Remember to update this README with instructions on how to install, run and test your application
* Your first goal is to have a working app, but feel free to improve the application however you see fit
* We hope that you can complete the assignment within 2 hours but don't set any time constraints
* Please reach out per email or by opening an issue if anything is unclear or blocking you

Best of luck

## Dev Notes

* Leave any technical notes on any libraries or tools you chose to use, the more detail the better.

### How to run app & test

In the project directory, you can run:

* `nvm use 14` if you aren't already using version 14.

* `npm install`

* `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

* `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### Future Improvements

Feel free to elaborate on how you would improve any of the following topics 

* Code Structuring:

I tried to group my components small with related styles in each component's folder to improve readability.

* Refactoring:

With more time I would have put more effort into my error handling, accessibility and making everything tabbable, styling, unit tests, better labeling and tooltips.

* Additional Features:

I'd love to see this app use pagination, search autocompletion with fuzzy keywords, and sorting functionality.
